    When called, it will be given a tensor image matrix. It will verify that it
    is compatible with the yolo model before working.

    Once verified, The model will then scan the image matrix for books. The
    model uses segmentation, meaning it will attempt to 'cut' out the object
    it finds rather than attempting to use general bounding boxes.

    It will then return a json containing a list that holds the data for each
    book found by the model.

    Returns:
        A list of dicts for each book found.
        Each dict has the following traits:
            "box": Contains the bounding coordinates of the box.
            "class": Class number this object is. Can be safely ignored.
            "confidence": How confident the model is in the guess. 0 to 1.
            "name": Name of object. Always 'book' or 'books'
        the confidence the model has and the type of object it thinks it is.

        If an error/issue is found, it will instead return an error dict.
